Hello world? These may be simple words, but they carry a lot of power, especially for me, as they mark the beginning of something new.</p>

<p>So, this is my very first post, the start of my journey into writing articles and blogs. What can you expect here?</p>

<p>Hopefully, you’ll find some tech articles related to the Apple ecosystem in general. However, you might also come across posts that are more personal or reflective in nature. But first…</p>

<h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am?</h2>

<p>My name is Ignacio Gomez, and I hold a degree in Software Engineering.
I have been working in the tech industry for 10 years, primarily within the Apple ecosystem. I’ve had the opportunity to work in various companies of different sizes and with multiple teams.
I love technology as much as I love the products I can build using it, I consider myself very passionate person.</p>

<p>Passion.. if I had to describe myself in one word, I would choose <strong>passionate</strong>.
I believe that all my goals can’t be fully realized without a significant amount of passion, and I see it as the main differentiator.</p>

<p>Today, by starting this blog, I aim to share one of my passions, which is programming.</p>

<p>Whoever is on the other side, I hope you find it helpful.</p>

<p>Until the next post, and remember: Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish</p>]]></content><author><name>Ignacio Gómez</name><email>ignaciohugog@gmail.com</email></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello world! Hello world?
